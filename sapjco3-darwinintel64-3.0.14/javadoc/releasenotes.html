<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in internal connection pool management for recovering from pool exhaustions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Sometimes an internally managed connection pool did not recover from a pool exhaustion situation and permanently
threw a <code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>JCO_ERROR_RESOURCE</code> when trying to execute a remote
function module. This error situation could only have occurred if the respectively used destination was <em>not</em>
configured with the property <code>jco.destination.max_get_client_time</code> set to <code>0</code> and furthermore
regular pool exhaustion exceptions for this destination already occurred before.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for improving the network stability during long running RFC client calls</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo now sends CPIC keep alive pings in regular time intervals to the SAP gateway during long running RFC client
calls in order to prevent firewalls and other network devices from closing the used underlying TCP/IP socket after
some low level network connection idle timeout although the respective RFC call is still being executed and
processed at the target AS ABAP back-end system. Additionally, this new CPIC keep alive ping feature also helps
with promptly detecting network errors and the loss of the RFC communication partner, so that an appropriate
<code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>JCO_ERROR_COMMUNICATION</code> can be thrown in such cases.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for native crash in message server service layer</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A native crash could have occurred when doing a load balanced logon via the SAP message server.<br>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for usage of the RFC protocol's basXML serialization with NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.02 (7.0 EhP 2) systems</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The RFC protocol's basXML serialization was not considered and not used when communicating with an AS ABAP system
of release 7.02. If a function module is flagged to support basXML in an AS ABAP system release 7.02, JCo is now
using this flag in an associated <code>JCoRepository</code> for the queried <code>JCoFunctionTemplate</code> from
that system. Furthermore, the runtime is now adhering the flag when communicating with 7.02 AS ABAP systems, thus
improving performance when exchanging large data in parameters belonging to an import, export, or changing
parameter list.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for querying meta data from a JCoRepository in roundtrip optimization mode</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A <code>JCoRepository</code> instance in roundtrip optimization mode (i.e. the middleware property
<code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> was set to <code>1</code> at its creation time) could have
returned incomplete meta data for nested structures, e.g. if a structure contains nested structured elements like
tables only. As the meta data was not initialized completely, the <code>JCoStructure</code> instances being created
from it did not contain the nested <code>JCoTable</code> instances.<br>
At runtime this could have lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> being thrown with a call stack as follows:
<pre>
java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.conn.jco.rt.DefaultTable.clear() of
a null object returned from com.sap.conn.jco.rt.AbstractRecord.getTable(int)

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for native crash in JCoServer communication with SNC</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A native crash could have occurred when receiving an RFC request from ABAP to Java that was
secured with SNC (Secure Network Communication).<br>
Please see SAP note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2156181">2156181</a> for further details.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement with invalidating the internal DNS cache</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
IP addresses, resolved host names, network services and resolved port numbers from the DNS (Domain Name System)
are internally cached by JCo in order to speed up the network performance. However, this behavior prevents to
set up DNS failover or DNS load balancing scenarios. And if the network configuration is changed, a restart of
the whole JCo process is required in order to clear the local DNS cache and to work with the changed TCP/IP
configuration again.<br>
So the JCo has been enhanced and its internal local DNS cache can now be configured to invalidate and remove
the DNS cache contents in regular time intervals. Two new JCo properties are now available for this:
<code>jco.ni.dnscache.ttl</code> and <code>jco.ni.dnscache.negative.ttl</code>. These properties can be set as
JVM startup parameters by using the <code>-D</code> JVM option and can also be modified during runtime via
API call. The properties define the time to live for DNS cache entries in seconds.<br>
Please see the API documentation at method <code>JCo.setProperty(String key, String value)</code> for further
details.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for hanging JCoServer connections</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
If an RFC request was immediately sent to a just registered <code>JCoServer</code> RFC connection, this newly
registered RFC server connection could have get into an unrecoverable hanging situation before the incoming
RFC request could have been dispatched and processed. At the communication partner side the RFC request did
not return and the active RFC connection kept hanging in status 'connected'.<br>
<em>Note:</em> This bug was present since JCo release 3.0.10 and was not completely fixed with JCo release 3.0.11.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement for detecting network errors at sending CPIC pings</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Network errors were not detected when sending CPIC keep alive pings for registered <code>JCoServer</code>
connections. The mechanism was only useful for avoiding that TCP/IP connections are getting closed by
some network hardware, routers, firewalls or other proxies because of network connection idle timeouts.
Now also network errors will be recognized by this mechanism so that hanging <code>JCoServer</code>
connections can be avoided in case of detectable network errors as well. Please see SAP note
<a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2079312">2079312</a> for further details.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for missing Unicode metadata in JCoRepository</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
If the initialization of a new <code>JCoRepository</code> object failed for whatever reason, e.g. because an
<code>RFC_ERROR_COMMUNICATION</code> occurred at opening the first RFC connection to the associated AS ABAP
system, this <code>JCoRepository</code> instance did never query and store Unicode RFC metadata in its cache.
This resulted in a follow-up error with an internal <code>java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> to
be thrown when executing a remote function call due to the missing metadata.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in JCoRepository instance management</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Under special circumstances a <code>JCoRepository</code> instance was sometimes dropped and removed from the
JCo runtime's central repository storage when a related destination configuration was deleted from the
<code>JCoDestinationManager</code>. In this case all the RFC metadata that was cached within the dropped
<code>JCoRepository</code> instance was lost and - if needed again - had to be queried from the associated
SAP system once again, which usually is a very time consuming task.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in method JCoAttributes.getPartnerHost()</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The method <code>JCoAttributes.getPartnerHost()</code> might have returned a wrong partner host name if the
destination that provided the <code>JCoAttributes</code> instance was configured for logon load balancing
and was running in a stateful context.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for configuration exceptions in extern-to-extern client communication scenarios</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When using a destination instance that targets an external RFC server program, a call to method <code>JCoFunction.execute(destination, ...)</code>
always threw a <code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>JCO_ERROR_CONFIGURATION</code>, if the
destination was not configured with a valid <code>'jco.destination.repository_destination'</code> property.
However, no repository is needed at this time for executing a remote function call in an external RFC server
program. Hence, throwing a <code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>JCO_ERROR_CONFIGURATION</code>
was not justified in this calling context.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support of stateful extern-to-extern RFC client communication with started RFC server programs</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Support for stateful extern-to-extern RFC client communication with started RFC server programs has been
added. It is now possible to use a stateful call context with <code>JCoContext.begin(destination)</code> and
<code>JCoContext.end(destination)</code> to destinations that target started external RFC server programs.<br>
<em>Note:</em> Stateful extern-to-extern RFC client communication with registered RFC server programs still
remains unsupported.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for lost scope types when using JCoCustomDestinations</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Scope types were lost when using <code>JCoCustomDestination</code> instances. Remote function calls via a
<code>JCoCustomDestination</code> instance were always executed within the default scope type context. In
case that the current JCo context was stateful, this resulted in the same RFC connection being used for all
<code>JCoCustomDestination</code> instances and therefore possibly destroyed the integrity of an LUW
(Logical Unit of Work).<br>
<em>Note:</em> This bug was present in JCo release 3.0.10 only.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for hanging JCoServer connections</b></td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in connection pool management at program termination</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When shutting down the JCo application program, pooled idle and still open RFC connections were not closed
properly before the application program terminates. This resulted in these pooled RFC connections being
interrupted instead with getting CPIC error messages<br>
<code>"Connection to partner '&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt' broken / Connection reset by peer"</code>
at the RFC communication partner side.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in method JCoRepository.save()</b></td></tr>

A <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code> was thrown when saving a <code>JCoRepository</code> instance
which contained a remote function module template with an empty import parameter list.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in method JCoRepository.load()</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The meta data information that specifies if a parameter is an optional parameter or not was lost after loading
a <code>JCoRepository</code> instance from a Java I/O character stream. Calling method
<code>JCoListMetaData.isOptional(&lt;name|index&gt;)</code> on any parameter meta data that was loaded by a
<code>JCoRepository</code> always returned <code>false</code> in this case.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in error handling when logging on to non-Unicode ABAP systems</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code> was always thrown when trying to logon to a non-Unicode ABAP
system with using one of the new logon languages that are available in Unicode SAP systems only. Now an
appropriate <code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>RFC_ERROR_LOGON_FAILURE</code> will be thrown in
such a scenario instead.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement with transferring the caller program name to the RFC communication partner</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A caller program name is now sent to the communication partner when opening a new RFC connection. It can be
retrieved from the RFC attributes at the communication partner side. The caller program name <code>'SAPJCo30'</code>
is used per default. An arbitrary custom program name can be set by specifying the Java system property
<code>-Djco.program_name=&lt;ProgramName&gt;</code> as a JVM startup parameter.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement at starting JCoServer instances</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Starting <code>JCoServer</code> instances has been improved with now doing lazy initializations of RFC repository
destinations and with ignoring and tolerating RFC communication errors at startup.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement at runtime initialization with adding a multi-platform library loading feature</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The JCo runtime initialization has been enhanced with a multi-platform library loading feature which allows
to create a central JCo installation that can be started on various operating systems and with using different
Java Virtual Machines without any configuration change. For example, JCo can now be installed on a single
central network share and be used from several operating systems like Windows, Linux or Mac OS X simultaneously.
Or one can work locally with a single JCo installation and use a 32-bit and a 64-bit JVM simultaneously or
choose one or the other JVM alternately at will.<br>
For using this feature it is only required to put all desired platform dependent JCo JNI libraries in specifically
named subdirectories of the directory where the <code>sapjco3.jar</code> file resides,
e.g. <code>&lt;sapjco3.jar_DIR&gt;\ntamd64\sapjco3.dll</code>, <code>&lt;sapjco3.jar_DIR&gt;\ntintel\sapjco3.dll</code>
or <code>&lt;sapjco3.jar_DIR&gt;/linuxppc64/libsapjco3.so.</code><br>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix removing a memory leak in the JCo session management</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A memory leak was removed within the internal JCo session management. The memory leak occurred after a custom
<code>SessionReferenceProvider</code> implementation had been registered at the JCo runtime environment. Its
method <code>SessionReferenceProvider.isSessionAlive(sessionId)</code> was never called which resulted in
numerous JCo session objects not getting freed although the sessions already had expired.<br>
<em>Note:</em> This bug was present in JCo release 3.0.9 only.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Performance bugfix at RFC request dispatching to JCoServers</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
In case of RFC server registrations to some SAP gateway taking a long time for whatever reason (e.g. because the relevant
SAP AS ABAP system or SAP gateway is currently in shutdown or startup phase, the host itself is not reachable via network
or due to network performance issues), the whole RFC request dispatching to all running <code>JCoServer</code> instances
was extremely slow and therefore lead to a performance degradation also of those registered JCo RFC servers and
related SAP AS ABAP systems who actually were not connected to the problematic SAP gateway host.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support of extern-to-extern RFC communication</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Support for calling external RFC server programs as well as support for receiving RFC requests from external RFC client
programs has been added.<br>
For addressing external RFC server programs the property <code>jco.client.tpname</code>, which specifies the appropriate
registered server program ID, can now be configured for a destination, which then can be used for calling RFC programs
that are registered at a SAP gateway. Additionally, the property <code>jco.destination.repository_destination</code>
should be configured and refer to some destination targeting an appropriate SAP AS ABAP system for retrieving
potentially required RFC meta data.<br>
Receiving RFC requests from external RFC client programs is not allowed by default for security reasons.
A <code>JCoException</code> with error group <code>JCoException.JCO_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE</code> will be thrown to both
RFC communication partners everytime a JCo RFC server receives such an RFC request. For allowing external RFC client
program calls to be processed by a JCo RFC server an administrator needs to specify the Java system property
<code><nobr>-Djco.allow_non_abap_partner=1</nobr></code> as a JVM startup parameter to be already available at JCo
framework initialization time. Please see SAP note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1877907">1877907</a>
for further details.<br>
<em><b>Caution:</b></em> For security reasons SAP discourages to run such extern-to-extern RFC communication scenarios.
External or registered RFC server programs are not able to check and authenticate incoming RFC requests from external
non-ABAP programs with regard to the pure RFC protocol data. Each of such external RFC requests must be regarded as
insecure.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for StackOverflowError in JCoRepository</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Depending on the defined DDIC (Data Dictionary) types and structures and on the defined RFM (Remote Function Module)
interfaces at SAP AS ABAP system side a <code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code> could have been thrown when a
<code>JCoRepository</code> instance was storing the queried RFC meta data into its internal <code>MetaDataStorage</code>
instance.
</td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for avoiding connection interruptions at long running stateful RFC server requests</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Long running stateful RFC server requests from ABAP to Java were always interrupted after the configured session timeout
interval (default is 10 minutes) without checking at the registered <code>SessionReferenceProvider</code> if the session

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for RFC callback handling</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
RFC callbacks to the JCo framework were not handled correctly. Although receiving an RFC callback is not an error by itself,
there was always an error of type <code>RfcGetException</code> with message "Received a callback from the communication partner"
logged in the RFC error log file <code>dev_jco_rfc.trc</code>. Despite this log entry, no error or exception was thrown to
the JCo application or signalled to the communication partner. Even if the requested RFC function module was not available
and could not be processed, this was not done and the RFC callback was ignored. If the delta management for RFC table parameters
was active, the erroneous RFC callback handling could furthermore have caused lost table data and table data inconsistencies
between the two communication partners.<br>
Now RFC callbacks are handled correctly with throwing a <code>JCoException</code> of error group

API. See also note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1406061">1406061</a>.

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for dealing with bgRFC units</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
It is now possible to interact with SAP AS ABAP back-ends supporting the successor of tRFC and qRFC
completely in native bgRFC mode, both for client and server applications. Certainly, the back-end release
has to support bgRFC as well. For details check out the API documentation of the interfaces and enums below:
<code>
<ul>
    <li>JCoFunctionUnit
    <li>JCoRequestUnit
    <li>JCoUnitIdentifier
    <li>JCoBackgroundUnitAttributes
    <li>JCoFunctionUnitState
    <li>JCoServerUnitIDHandler
</ul>
</code>

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for ABAP class exceptions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Starting with ABAP application server release 7.11 it is possible to use function modules throwing an
abap class exception between two ABAP systems. With 7.20 the support was extended to connectors as well,
including JCo 3.0. Hence, more context of the application in the ABAP system can be transferred in
such an exception object, which makes it easier to find causes of undesired behavior of the application.
For details check out the API documentation of the classes and interfaces below:
<code>
<ul>
    <li>AbapClassException
    <li>JCoRemoteContext
    <li>JCoAbapObject
    <li>JCoClassMetaData
    <li>JCoFunction
</ul>
</code>
</td></tr>

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Changing parameters are not updated</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When a function module had a changing parameter, and the application did not set any value to it, before
invoking function module in the back-end, the updates to it in the back-end were not received by the Java
application.
</td></tr>

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>StackOverflowError in MetaDataStorage</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Under certain circumstances it could occur when some metadata object is stored in a
repository's data store. The call stack of the error included the following sequence very often:
<pre>
    at com.sap.conn.jco.rt.MetaDataStorage.updateParents()
    at com.sap.conn.jco.rt.MetaDataStorage.saveRecordMetaData()

<tr><td>
See also note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1358698">1358698</a>.
If a table or strufture definition was extended compatibly between two releases by simply extending the last field, e.g.
by extending a CHAR 5 field to CHAR 10, and JCo was only aware of the shorter version of the metadata, but the longer one
was sent to JCo, the value of that field was simply not stored, and the field remained initial. In particular, this occurred
as well, if there was only a single field in the structure or table row.

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Exception text was not sent to caller</b></td></tr>

When an implementation of a <code>JCoServerTIDHandler</code> threw an exception within checkTID, the text was
not sent to the caller.
</td></tr>

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>NullPointerException in JCoServer</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When a <code>JCoServer</code> was started twice, because of some minor changes, and was not stopped properly before,
and the <code>ServerDataProvider</code> did not support events, this could lead to a NullPointerException, when a
new request for this server was coming in.

<tr><td>
See also note <a href="https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1298438">1298438</a>.
When setting its connections to stateful, a <code>JCoServer</code> could hang completely when the gateway on which the server has been registered is
sending a ping to the server connection because the ABAP client has not been sending requests for a while. The JCoServer connection then
ends up in a call stack for server threads in a thread dump that looks similar to the following one:

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix in treatment of one-digit BCD value</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
BCD fields were filled incorrectly if a one-digit value was set (e.g. 4 or 7). The resulting value was always 0 (or 0.0 - with n 0 after the dot if the number of decimals is n in the metadata definition).
</td></tr>

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for exception group in case of wrong credentials</b></td></tr>

<ul>
    <li>It was possible that the context which timed out was not removed from the list of existing contexts by the session
        timeout checker. This could create unnecessary checks for sessions that have already been cleaned up.
    <li>Contexts that have been initiated by a stateful JCo server were not removed immediately after the connection
        had been closed by the ABAP client.

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for session events triggered by JCoServer connections</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The events for sessions started by a <code>JCoServer</code> could be triggered more often than necessary. In particular, this was
true for the <code>jcoServerSessionStarted()</code> event, for which then there did not exist a corresponding <code>jcoServerSessionFinished()</code>
event. As a consequence too many idling sessions were created in the runtime environment.

table types that referred to a table type as line type which referse to a domain as line type were not correctly
stored in the repository, when being looked up from an ABAP system. As a consequence function modules that had parameters
of such a type could not be processed correctly.

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for functions containing more than 127 non-scalar parameters</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Functions with more than 127 non-scalar parameters caused an <code>ArrayIndexOfBoundsException</code>. The fix required a change for the
serial version UID of many data containers and metadata instances so that serialized instances of these classes can no longer be exchanged
with previous releases.

<tr  BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on receive</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions</code> might be thrown while receiving data (output parameters in client scenario or
